Essay 2

Tell us about your current and near-term career-related activities and goals, indicating how you see your current work and study informing your forthcoming academic work and early career goals.

If you are already enrolled in, or have been accepted into the program for which you seek support under this Fellowship, tell us why you chose that program. If you are still applying for one or more programs for which you will seek support under this Fellowship, tell us about the primary considerations that are shaping your aspirations and priorities.

I am currently enrolled as a first year medical student at Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S). Before visiting Columbia, I wasn’t sure that I would enjoy the speed and crowdedness of such a large city but now I couldn’t be happier with my choice. The people at P&S have a creative spirit and passion for everything from medicine to music that electrifies the air. New York City’s roots in arts and culture run so deep that the diversity is palpable and adds a whole new dimension to my medical school experience.

A big part of why I decided to come to P&S was that the school places great emphasis on maintaining one’s individuality and creativity throughout medical school. Through club activities I have found various ways to stay true to who I was before the transformative process of medical school, especially through music. I now play music even more than I did in college, collaborating with my classmates on cello duets and piano trios. We play every so often for patients at the rehabilitation center in Milstein Hospital, hopefully bringing them some entertainment after long, arduous days. I will also perform Beethoven and Mozart with P&S’ own orchestra in November on the cello. Improvisation, which is usually quite difficult for me as a classically trained musician, has become a challenging but magical exercise that my friends and I like to do with all the lights turned off--we focus on a theme, listen to each other, and somehow weave together beautiful melodies and tumultuous cadences in harmony. The musical experience at P&S alone has given me a personally rewarding platform for exercising my creativity; it is a welcome reminder of my individuality amidst the all-consuming process of medical school.

That said, despite how mentally overwhelming medical school can be, I thoroughly enjoy much of the academic side at P&S. Part of the curriculum includes a course on the Foundations of Clinical Medicine that has meant the world to me so far. We talk about how to interview patients to get their whole story, how to practice the art of medicine. As part of the course, I was paired with the chair of pediatric palliative care for a shadowing clerkship. Just five hours of clerkship has felt more educational to me than all my hours of clinical experience during my undergraduate years! I have now seen a whole new side of medicine that I never noticed as an issue before. 

Through observing pediatric palliative care in action, I have grown to appreciate that while modern medicine has capabilities to keep someone “alive,” it does not necessarily mean that doctors should always use it to keep people from dying. For example, should a one-year-old baby girl with Down Syndrome and chloromas from leukemia pressing on her brainstem continue to stay in the hospital to undergo a fifth round of possibly futile chloroma treatment, or do her parents want to bring her home and let her live her last few weeks playing at the park and being with her little brother? In another case, perhaps it have aligned more with the family’s goals for care if the doctors had not performed a tracheostomy on their dying fourteen year old, who was declining rapidly after a bone marrow transplant, because her impaired speech severely worsened her clinical depression. Through involvement in end of life situations like these, I have become more conscious of medicine as a service, not a requirement, and have learned about the importance of addressing patients’ and their families’ goals for care.

I’ve grown to believe that dying ought to be treated with as much respect and dignity as life--while death itself is consistent for each human on Earth, the process of dying has no default, just like the process of living. Today, the technology that we possess threatens the acceptance of mortality and therefore the emotional closure that people often need to come to terms with passing. Palliative care--a small but slowly growing branch at P&S--strives to remedy this issue at New York Presbyterian. As a student here, I have the opportunity to observe and reflect on the discussions that make death with dignity a greater possibility. I hope to carry these experiences with me throughout my medical education as I learn how to balance goals of care with the parallel practice of medical science. 

In another facet of my curriculum, I have chosen to pursue a Master’s degree in Biomedical Informatics in conjunction with my medical degree. The dual program at P&S allows me to broaden my research skills through extra biostatistics courses and clinical and translational research seminars. Most importantly, the program also provides dedicated time for me to conduct a year and a half of concentrated research in Biomedical Informatics and get in-depth practical research experience. 

Technology is taking root in every aspect of our lives and medicine will be no different. With the incredible amounts of data available and the constant development of new and improved sequencing and robotics technology, being well-versed in Biomedical Informatics will be an invaluable skill. Even now, because I have a background in biology, I have the knowledge necessary for understanding what kinds of problems would be interesting and possible to solve using computers. Conversely, my practical experience with computer science and its limits give me an idea of what informatics research would be feasible. 

The nascent field of Biomedical Informatics is extremely broad and my interests in medicine are almost as broad, so I do not know what I will research I will do or what kind of doctor I want to be just yet. 









Cheesy alert… ughhhhh 
However, I am sure of one thing: I hope that both despite the technology revolution and in light of it, I can contribute to the current push for humanistic medicine, that is, patient-centered care. No matter what kind of doctor I become, I hope that I can remain true to the notion that medicine is caring for humans, for people who are interesting and diverse and who each have their own stories.
