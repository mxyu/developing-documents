Essay 2

Tell us about your current and near-term career-related activities and goals, indicating how you see your current work and study informing your forthcoming academic work and early career goals.

If you are already enrolled in, or have been accepted into the program for which you seek support under this Fellowship, tell us why you chose that program. If you are still applying for one or more programs for which you will seek support under this Fellowship, tell us about the primary considerations that are shaping your aspirations and priorities.

I am currently enrolled as a first year medical student at Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S). Before visiting Columbia I had my heart set on staying in California, where all of my family and friends live. New York City also intimidated me a bit: it’s so big, crowded, fast, and impersonal. Then I came here to P&S for my interview and the people I met changed my mind. Everyone I interacted with had an unbridled passion for learning, whether it was about medicine or art or music. Even though I wasn’t a student yet, I already felt like I was part of the babbyhood because I shared their excitement for learning. Now, I get to explore medicine alongside these people everyday and contribute my own passion and personality to P&S.

P&S emphasizes maintaining one’s individuality and creativity throughout medical school; it does this through the P&S Club, a conglomerate of various student activities and interest groups. I’m part of the Asian Pacific American Medical Student Association, over five medical specialty interest groups, the CUMC Symphony Orchestra, P&S Musicians’ Guild, P&S Basketball Club, Food for Thought, and I am an Interview Housing Liaison and Eco-Rep in our Class Council. It sounds like a lot, but it feels completely normal because so many of my classmates do as much as I do, if not more, and we all love it. 

Music has become a big part of my life once again. I now play music even more than I did in college. After classes, my new friends and I often mess around with cello duets and piano trios together. We play for patients at the rehabilitation center in Milstein Hospital, hopefully bringing them some entertainment after long, arduous days. Improvisation, which is usually quite difficult for me, has become a challenging but magical exercise that we like to do at night--we turn off the lights, focus on a theme, listen to each other, and weave together beautiful melodies and tumultuous cadences in harmony. It’s fun, spontaneous, creative, and full of dialogue. We each take turns leading without exactly knowing what should come next and together blaze a musical trail through the silence.

Academically, P&S has exceeded my expectations through its course on the Foundations of Clinical Medicine. We talk in intimate small group sessions about how to interview patients to get their whole story, how to practice the art of medicine. As part of the course, I was paired with the chair of Pediatric Palliative Care at the Children’s Hospital for a shadowing clerkship. Just five hours of clerkship has already educated me more than all my hours of clinical experience during my undergraduate years! 

Through observing pediatric palliative care in action, I have grown to appreciate that while modern medicine has capabilities to keep someone “alive,” doctors should not necessarily use it to keep people from dying. For example, should a one-year-old baby girl with Down Syndrome and chloromas from leukemia pressing on her brainstem continue to stay in the hospital to undergo a fifth round of possibly futile chloroma treatment, or do her parents want to bring her home and let her live her last few weeks playing at the park and being with her little brother? In another case, perhaps it would have aligned more with the family’s goals for care if the doctors had not performed a tracheostomy on their dying fourteen year old, who was declining rapidly after a bone marrow transplant, because her impaired speech severely worsened her clinical depression. Through involvement in end of life situations like these, I have become more conscious of medicine as a service, not a requirement--the focus of medicine is to provide care, whether that care is administration of a drug or something as obvious yet complex as a conversation. To provide the best care, doctors must first understand what patients and their families want for their lives; then they can make medical decisions that will best serve patients by helping them achieve those goals.

I’ve grown to believe that dying ought to be treated with as much respect and dignity as life. Today, the technology that we possess threatens the acceptance of mortality and therefore the emotional closure that people often need to come to terms with passing. Palliative care--a small but slowly growing branch at P&S--strives to remedy this issue at New York Presbyterian. As a student here, I have the opportunity to observe and reflect on the discussions that make death with dignity a greater possibility. I hope to carry these experiences with me throughout my education as I learn how to balance goals of care with the scientific medical science. 

In another facet of my curriculum, I have chosen to pursue a Master’s degree in Biomedical Informatics in conjunction with my medical degree. The dual program at P&S allows me to broaden my research skills through extra biostatistics courses and clinical and translational research seminars. Most importantly, the program also provides dedicated time for me to conduct a year and a half of concentrated research in Biomedical Informatics and get in-depth practical research experience. 

Technology is taking root in every aspect of our lives and medicine will be no different. With the incredible amounts of data available and the constant development of new and improved sequencing and robotics technology, being well-versed in Biomedical Informatics will be an invaluable skill. Even now, because I have a background in biology, I have the knowledge necessary for understanding what kinds of problems would be interesting and possible to solve using computers. Conversely, my practical experience with computer science and its limits give me an idea of what informatics research would be feasible. 

The nascent field of Biomedical Informatics is extremely broad and my interests in medicine are almost as broad, so I do not know what I will research I will do or what kind of doctor I want to be just yet. 









Cheesy alert… ughhhhh 
However, I am sure of one thing: I hope that both despite the technology revolution and in light of it, I can contribute to the current push for humanistic medicine, that is, patient-centered care. No matter what kind of doctor I become, I hope that I can remain true to the notion that medicine is caring for humans, for people who are interesting and diverse and who each have their own stories.
