I am currently enrolled as a first year medical student at Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons (henceforth P&S). I love the creative energy and curiosity that fuels the learning process here. From diverse extracurriculars to specialized, innovative research, P&S fosters an ideal environment for me to express myself and develop as an individual while learning how to practice medicine.

Between molecular mechanisms of disease and clinical gross anatomy courses, I participate in numerous activities that keep my creative juices flowing and help me stay energized despite the stressful workload. I play intramural basketball every week and sweat it out with first year medical students on the court. As a member of the Asian Pacific American Medical Student Association (APAMSA), I have the opportunity to connect with students from many programs on campus, learning about my peers and their different backgrounds, from what they study to where they are from. I am also a member of our class council as Eco Representative and have begun a campaign for campus-wide conservation of paper towels, using the Bay Area’s “These Come From Trees” stickers in our campus restrooms. 

After classes, my classmates and I also play a lot of music. We play for patients at the rehabilitation center in Milstein Hospital, bringing them some aural variation after long days at the center. We also play just for each other—improvisation, which is usually quite difficult for me, has become a challenging but magical exercise. We turn off the lights, listen to each other, and weave tumultuous cadences together in harmony. It’s fun, spontaneous, and full of dialogue. We each take turns leading without exactly knowing what should come next and together blaze a musical trail through the silence. I have learned that communication and listening are paramount for improvisation; practicing these skills through music has even helped me become more proactive about teamwork in anatomy labs and small groups. I hope that my musical adventures, in addition to my other extracurricular activities, will continue to contribute to the process of learning and practicing medicine as I exercise my creativity and individuality throughout my career. 

In addition to the great variety of extracurriculars, P&S sets itself apart through its academic courses—the Foundations of Clinical Medicine course alone has really given me a wealth of additional perspective on the practice of medicine itself. We talk in intimate small group sessions about how to interview patients to get their whole story, how to practice the art of medicine. As part of the course, I was paired with the chair of Pediatric Palliative Care at the Children’s Hospital for a shadowing clerkship. Just five hours of clerkship has already educated me more than all my hours of clinical experience during my undergraduate years. 

Through observing pediatric palliative care in action, I have grown to appreciate that while modern medicine may be able to offer the capabilities to keep someone “alive” in the biological sense, the role of doctors is not necessarily to postpone clinical death using whatever means available. For example, should a one-year-old baby girl with Down Syndrome and chloromas from leukemia pressing on her brainstem continue to stay in the hospital to undergo a fifth round of possibly futile chloroma treatment, or should her parents bring her home and let her live her last few weeks playing at the park and being with her little brother? In another case, perhaps it would have aligned more with the family’s goals for care if the doctors had not performed a tracheostomy on their dying fourteen year old, who was declining rapidly after a bone marrow transplant, because her impaired speech severely worsened her clinical depression. 

Through involvement in end-of-life situations like these, I have become more conscious of medicine as a service-oriented profession—that is, again, even though medical treatments exist, using them is not always in the best interest of the patient. There are other things we have to offer as a service, such as counseling and comfort. The focus of medicine is to provide care, whether that care is administration of a drug or something as obvious yet complex as a conversation. I have learned from my clerkship that for doctors to provide the best care, they must first understand how patients and their families view life, what they fear and hope for; only then can they can make medical decisions that will best serve patients and help them achieve those goals. I hope to keep these complex clinical experiences at the forefront of my decision-making when I try to provide the best care for my future patients.

In another facet of my curriculum, I have chosen to pursue a Master’s degree in Biomedical Informatics. The dual degree program at P&S has already exposed me to dozens of research topics through translational research seminars, topics ranging from immunotherapy for melanomas to transcriptome mapping of glioblastomas. Inspired by the diverse and exciting talks, I am eager to pursue a research project in either translational bioinformatics or improvement of electronic medical record systems in the dedicated time set aside by the program for research. There are incredible amounts of data available in the medical field—with biomedical informatics, we can harness that data to uncover biological mechanisms of disease, better understand and improve clinical practice, and push the medical field forward using technology.

The specifics of my future career are still up in the air: my interests change from week to week, darting between neurosurgery, pediatrics, internal medicine… the list goes on. Fortunately, there are so many great mentors at P&S who each inspire me to do what they do. Each faculty seems to have found his or her perfect academic or clinical niche by finding a problem that inspires them and striving to solve it. Like my mentors at P&S, I hope to go down a career path in which I can uniquely integrate my passions for patient centered care with biomedical informatics to creatively and compassionately solve problems in medicine.
