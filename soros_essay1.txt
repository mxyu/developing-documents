Essay 1

Tell us about your experiences as a New American – whether as an immigrant yourself or as a child of immigrants – and how those experiences have informed and shaped what you have accomplished so far in your life.

The program is especially interested in accomplishments – in any aspect of your life - that help us understand your originality, initiative and creativity. Feel free to discuss how parents, teachers, mentors and or institutions have supported – or impeded – your progress. If you believe that distinctive features of American governance and society have been important to an understanding of your story, feel free to discuss that as well. (1000 words or less)

========================

In Chinese, "ni" is a flavor that gets old quickly, but not in the same way it gets old when you eat too much of something. You can tell that a dish is "ni" from the first bite. It’s difficult to translate exactly to English. Growing up in an immigrant household, interlacing words like "ni" with English sentences was commonplace. I saw the world through two linguistic lenses--while I spoke primarily in English, Chinese gave me an additional frame with which to learn and think about the world.

In high school, after taking some basic neuroscience, this bilingual phenomenon that I experienced first hand started tugging at the scientist in me. I grew increasingly fascinated by the brain, how people learn, and how people perceive the world in so many dimensions through the binary neuron. I wanted to understand the mechanisms behind the brain like I understood how gas travels in capillaries and how the intestine absorbs nutrients. Neuroscience was only so advanced, though; the scientific world could not yet answer my questions in full. In the summer after tenth grade, I joined the search and conducted my first wet lab research at the Learning and Memory Lab at University of California, Irvine, studying the mechanisms of learning at a very basic level in Aplysia (Californian giant sea slugs). By the end of summer, I had accomplished a significant amount of work but I only had data to describe a single protein in part of a single pathway, not even in a human but in a giant sea slug. Needless to say, my project left me wanting more, my big questions still unsolved; however, I was proud that I was able to contribute to research that might one day provide some answers.

I went on to college, excited to dive deeper into neuroscience. And dive deeper I did, through further coursework and research; however, as educational as the academics were, the richest part of my education came from the people around me. Living with an Australian roommate, being best friends with the entire Indian dance team Basmati Raas, and having a boyfriend who strongly identified with Taiwanese culture sent a jolt through my core. I had been so busy doing research and studying in books that I hadn't really paid as much attention to my cultural heritage as I could have. The diverse people around me at Stanford reminded me that as much as I was an American, I was also a Chinese descendant with values and traditions that held roots in Taiwanese and Chinese culture. I celebrated Chinese holidays with my family, felt nostalgic listening to music sung by Teresa Teng, consumed Chinese medicines at home, ate foods according to their "hot" or "cold" characteristics, and even practiced my family's superstitions, things like not cutting your hair within a week of the New Year, disliking the number four, and never giving umbrellas to friends as gifts.

As I engaged with the diverse people around me, picking up snippets of their cuisines, cultures, and traditions, I went on a personal journey to reclaim my own. I started by taking Chinese for bilingual students, learning about pieces of Chinese history and how to read and write Chinese. In sophomore year, I discovered ceramics and completely fell in love with throwing pottery, connecting with my cultural heritage through clay--one of the first lidded vessels I threw was a claypot, modeled after the claypots that my mom and grandma used at home to make my favorite pork stews. When I visited Taiwan for the first time in a decade with my boyfriend, his family took me to the Yingge Ceramics Museum, one of the most renowned ceramics museums in the world. Inspired by the incredible ceramic artists of Taiwan, I spent hours in the studio in my senior year creating iterations of bowls with artistic influences from both Asia and California. 

With the environment and freedom to explore my own culture and others, I grew increasingly aware of a piece of American culture that is central to my identity, that is, the amalgamation of many cultures. Being part of the melting pot experience has given me the ability to wear different hats, see things easily from different perspectives, and understand people who think and live differently than I do. I actively wore some of my many hats in the Stanford Robotics Lab--not only did I carry a unique perspective from being one of the few women in the department, but I also had a distinct background in biology and neuroscience that many in robotics did not have. Alongside my phenomenal research mentor, who had an even more diverse background than I did, I collaborated with robotics, physics, mathematics, and psychology experts to decipher how the human brain controls muscles. Each person brought something unique to the table, giving our team various angles from which to explore the same problem; without such an interdisciplinary team, it would not have been feasible to use a robot in conjunction with functional MRI to attempt to understand how people’s brains move their muscles.

Now that I am attending medical school in New York City, arguably the most diverse city in the world, I am excited to absorb and learn about other cultures and traditions, from that of the medical field at large to that of the Dominican population surrounding Columbia’s medical school. I hope that my new American experiences will enhance my ability to be a compassionate physician, one who can understand without passing judgment and advocate for patients with an open mind.
