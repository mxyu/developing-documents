Essay 1

Tell us about your experiences as a New American – whether as an immigrant yourself or as a child of immigrants – and how those experiences have informed and shaped what you have accomplished so far in your life.

The program is especially interested in accomplishments – in any aspect of your life - that help us understand your originality, initiative and creativity. Feel free to discuss how parents, teachers, mentors and or institutions have supported – or impeded – your progress. If you believe that distinctive features of American governance and society have been important to an understanding of your story, feel free to discuss that as well. (1000 words or less)

========================

In Chinese, "ni" (fourth tone) is a flavor that gets old quickly, similar to the way that a flavor gets old when you eat too much of it, but you can tell that a dish is "ni" from the first bite. It’s difficult to translate exactly to English, especially because it is different from person to person; for example, artificial cherry flavor and parsley are “ni” to me but I know plenty of people who would never call either of those “ni.” Growing up in an immigrant household, where I could interlace Chinese words like “ni” in English conversation, gave me the opportunity to view the world through two linguistic lenses and an additional frame with which to learn and think about the world.
 
By the time I got to college, however, my Chinese heritage had all but waned out of view from my American identity. Losing pieces of my cultural heritage was like falling asleep; it happened gradually and quietly, and I didn’t know I had lost these pieces of myself until I woke up on the other side, until I felt their absence. This sense of loss became acutely apparent to me only after I left home and went to college, where I was bombarded with reminders of my Chinese and immigrant heritage through the diverse student population around me. When interacting with my peers, I would reach for a piece of me that no longer fully existed; it was jarring. 

Reflecting back on high school, I realized that I had unintentionally neglected the experiences of my cultural heritage in favor of assimilating into American society, of passing as a normal American teenager at a predominantly upper middle class, caucasian school. Never did I feel a victim of an overwhelming social force; I think it was just so easy to grow new roots in fertile soil that neglecting old ones went unnoticed. Being in such a diverse environment as Stanford and missing the intimate connections with my family and peers that once stemmed from my cultural heritage fueled my desire to nurture all of my roots, both new and old.

As I engaged with the rich diversity of perspectives and experiences around me, exchanging snippets of cuisines, cultures, and traditions, I went on a personal journey to reexamine my own cultural identity. I wanted to figure out where my Chinese heritage fit in with my American one. I started by taking Chinese for bilingual students, learning about pieces of Chinese history and how to read and write Chinese. In sophomore year, I discovered ceramics and completely fell in love with throwing pottery, connecting with my cultural heritage through clay--one of the first lidded vessels I threw was a claypot, modeled after the claypots that my mom and grandma used at home to make my favorite pork stews. When I visited Taiwan for the first time in a decade with my partner, his family took me to the Yingge Ceramics Museum, one of the most renowned ceramics museums in the world. Inspired by the incredible ceramic artists of Taiwan, I spent hours in the studio in my senior year creating iterations of bowls with artistic influences from both Asia and California. 

With both the impetus and freedom to explore my own culture and others, I grew increasingly aware of a piece of American culture that is central to my identity: that is, the amalgamation of many cultures. Being part of the melting pot experience has given me the ability to wear different hats, see things easily from different perspectives, and understand people who think and live differently than I do. 

I actively wore some of my many hats in the Stanford Robotics Lab--not only did I carry a unique perspective as one of the few women in the department, but I also had the distinction of a background in biology and neuroscience that many in robotics did not have. Alongside phenomenal research mentors, I collaborated with roboticists, physicists, mathematicians, and psychologists with the mutual goal of understanding how the human brain controls muscles. Each person brought something unique to the table, giving our team various angles from which to explore a single problem. Physicists worked out how to create a robot that would not disrupt the magnetic field of the fMRI scanner, roboticists and mathematicians connected the robot to a computer interface and force control algorithm, and psychologists and I integrated the biology of the brain with fMRI findings to correlate neural responses with muscle movement. With my dual background, I facilitated the connection between the robotics and fMRI arms of our project, having the capacity to program simulations that would most effectively test the underlying neuroscience. 

Now that I am attending medical school in New York City, arguably one of the most diverse cities in the world, I am eager to integrate my experiences as a New American with my medical education. With the capacity to absorb and learn about other cultures and an understanding of both assimilation and loss of heritage, I feel that I possess a unique perspective that will enable me to care for my patients through a deeper level of understanding and communication. I hope that my new American experiences will enhance my ability to be a compassionate physician, one who can understand without passing judgment and advocate for patients with an open mind.
