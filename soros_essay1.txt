Essay 1

Tell us about your experiences as a New American – whether as an immigrant yourself or as a child of immigrants – and how those experiences have informed and shaped what you have accomplished so far in your life.

The program is especially interested in accomplishments – in any aspect of your life - that help us understand your originality, initiative and creativity. Feel free to discuss how parents, teachers, mentors and or institutions have supported – or impeded – your progress. If you believe that distinctive features of American governance and society have been important to an understanding of your story, feel free to discuss that as well. (1000 words or less)

In taekwondo, the first thing you learn is how to fall. Similarly, the first thing you learn in sailing is how to capsize. When I started sailing, the first thing I learned was how to capsize. What’s the worst thing that could happen? You flip! And then you climb up on that centerboard, flip the boat back upright, clamber back into the hull, and catch some more breeze. Having that knowledge that I can get up after I fall takes a huge weight off my shoulders and enables me to take risks and perform at my best--while it may not eradicate that fear of failing completely, it gives me room to really explore my limits and sail fast. 

This mental state--having freedom to explore and space to fail--has allowed me to indulge my curiosities in a way that I can only describe as American. My family has not always had this American commodity, though; my parents came to this country each with one parent to support and no room for error. Instead of doing what they wanted to do, they often sacrificed their desires and did what they had to do in order to stay afloat. They reminisce sometimes about how they used to frequent Taco Bell, not because they liked the American rendition of Mexican food but because they couldn’t afford more than the fifty-cent taco diet. They couldn’t take risks because making mistakes was not an option. 

My parents’ hard work and sacrifice have made a space for me to explore the world without being afraid of failing. They raised me with an idea of success and happiness that was contrary to their own, revolving around intangible accomplishments rather than material ends. Throughout my life, I have fostered a deep appreciation for the journey in achieving something more than the achievement itself, where the material possessions that came with succeeding were mere side effects of the real treasure of doing. As a result, I have been able to chase my dreams, emulating my parents’ diligence and perseverance in pursuing the things that I love.






Have a connection with other asian americans - unique closeness with them
Slightly more distant from caucasian Americans & foreign Asians
Understanding how things work
Yacht club - surrounded by white people, such a different lifestyle
Jarring - preferred academics, specifically math/science because it was much more straightforward to figure out how things worked in that world. It was familiar, a universal language.

Germany - actual language and cultural barrier, i felt hyper aware of 

Language

English language - speaking the same language but still maybe not really understanding completely. Loss of language, not being able to communicate with family intimately. Gaining languages, being able to connect with people while traveling.

Come back to confront my former language/culture barriers between me and other people
Being an outsider, straddler of two cultures, enables me to more easily shift perspectives and understand people from different backgrounds.

Math and science, in contrast to English or Chinese, obey logic and possess universal rules. When I was in elementary school, I really loved math and science--I think it was because I struggled with languages early on. I started with horrible English, having spoken only Chinese in my early years, and then flipped the tables as I became more eloquent in English and more infantile in Chinese. 

I found a certain comfort in math and science

I craved a more firmly grounded form of communication, one that could transcend cultural differences, and began my lifelong search for a place in which I could completely belong. 

 so it was no wonder that I naturally gravitated toward math and science, where one could explain things almost exclusively in black and white.

learning about failure and exploration in a new light through research

Being a new american to me has been a lot about maintaining my family’s values and integrating them 

 I had the opportunity to fill my life with an array of stimuli: I started a lifelong relationship with piano at age six, flute at ten, cello at fourteen; I began sailing when I was twelve; I 

Sometimes, these values collided: for example, 
I used the same metal pencil box for fifteen years, given to me by my aunt from China, which had this cute little cartoon boy on it hauling a watermelon up a hill. I mostly kept it because I liked how good it was at holding my pens and how durable it was, and I guess it was kind of cute. But over the years, after I finally understood what its message was, I grew to love and hate it--on the lid it said, “You must work hard. Then finally you can enjoy it!” I understood that working hard was an important part of doing anything in my life. I truly relished the satisfaction in working hard. However, my parents raised me to appreciate the journey in achieving something more than the achievement itself; the material possessions that came with succeeding were mere side effects of the real treasure of doing. The pencil box was a parallel to my real life in a way though.

Fortunately, I came into this world in a time of prosperity for my family. I grew up with that American freedom to learn and explore, to fall and pick myself up again. Coming from an immigrant background, though, I was also bequeathed a set of values that stem from both Chinese culture and my parents’ specific American immigrant culture. From growing up in a Chinese household, I’ve inherited strong bonds of family and community, rooted in respect for elders and kindness towards others. From living with my diligent parents and experiencing first hand from playing music and sports, I’ve learned the importance of working hard and sticking with something no matter how difficult it seems and being resourceful to get around obstacles. I’ve learned about different meanings for success--from material to immaterial--and I over the years I have navigated through my different but intersecting cultures to determine what kinds of success mean the most to me.

When I first joined a yacht club so that I could sail competitively, I was the only non-caucasian American in sight; the experience was jarring not only because I looked different, but also because I clearly knew of and cared about different things. It was normal for people to talk back to their parents in hurtful ways that I could never imagine doing. Parents would give their children weekly spending money whereas I would give all of my new year’s money to my parents. Here I was, stuck between two cultures instead of feeling like a complete member of one or both. 

Even beyond language barriers, I also felt the presence of cultural differences between me and my peers that made it difficult for us to connect. That my two best friends were Asian Americans was no coincidence--the three of us fit together like cogs in a well oiled machine, but when we were among our other peers and even our families it seemed as if someone was trying to use our machine for a task other than the one it was designed for. 


Scratchwork

I am a Chinese American. There exists a slow but steady conflict in my life, one that is sometimes difficult to notice because it has made space for itself in our society--

As a child of two incredible people who made something out of nothing in this country, I actively live the American Dream. Through perseverance, hard work, and no small amount of sacrifice, my parents have earned prosperity and success, perhaps not so much in the monetary sense, but definitely in the intangible vein of happiness and freedom. It sounds cheesy, but it’s true--they provided me with a safe environment to thrive in and the choice to do things that make me happy. 

Achieving an American Dream of my own, while reconciling assimilation w cultural heritage.


My parents started out in this country as impoverished students bound to the fifty-cent Taco Bell diet, each with one parent to support and no safety net for catching failures.
